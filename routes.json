The line came under control of the Burlington Northern in the early 1970's, and was leased to Montana Rail Link (MRL) in the late 1980's.  While MRL maintains the right of way today, the line is owned by the BNSF railway, and is used extensively to move BNSF tonnage trains to the west coast.  BNSF traffic is primarily Powder River coal and grain from the Midwest.  BNSF also moves manifest, intermodal, and Boeing aircraft part trains. The remaining traffic is MRL-specific manifest trains. This is a modern interpretation of this piece of railroad, complete with high horsepower AC traction locomotives.  For those with a passion for nostalgia, MRL still uses cabooses on some local freights.",
